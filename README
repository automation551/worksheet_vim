*worksheet.txt*     Worksheets (Log of interaction with an interpreter)

This plugin provides "worksheets". These are supposed to be somewhat 
similar to workbooks in mathematica or maple. Basically, they provide 
input fields and related output fields, plus some convenience functions 
to move around and deal with the data in the fields.

Currently supported types of worksheet/interpreters:
    - vim (surprise! :)
    - ruby (requires |+ruby|)
    - rubymath (ruby with mathn loaded and Math included)
    - sh (shell)
    - r_com (R, windows only, requires rdcom and |+ruby|)
